### Project Description:

"The Named Data Networking (NDN) project aims to develop a new Internet architecture that can capitalize on strengths — and address weaknesses — of the Internet’s current host-based, point-to-point communication architecture in order to naturally accommodate emerging patterns of communication. By naming data instead of their locations, NDN transforms data into a first-class entity. The current Internet secures the data container. NDN secures the contents, a design choice that decouples trust in data from trust in hosts, enabling several radically scalable communication mechanisms such as automatic caching to optimize bandwidth." - https://named-data.net
### Problem:

Microservices generally have zero to no security. Extracting data from a location requires a lot of wetware.
### Solution:

Named Data Networking lifts application development to using names and builds security into the protocol.
### Stability:

Experimental
